# Code Shoulder 
### The Code Shoulder - A place to put all the code stuff that helped me along the way 
*** 

After getting asked by *many of my friends* how they can get started with programming/web development, I decided to put lots of **my resources and recommendations in a repository** that can be updated and shared easily. 

Checkout the [resources page](resources.md) for lots of learning type stuff or the [programs page](programs.md) to see some of the programs you'll probably be using/needing. 

Add stuff if you like! Enjoy!
