# Things You're Probably Going to Need
***

### Github 
Visit [Github.com](https://github.com) and start your own free account. Github (you're here now if you're reading this) is a fantastic tool that facilitates online storage of all of your programs and allows you to contribute to other projects you come across. 

### iTerm2 
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) was one of my fondest "discoveries" while in school. If you are using Terminal on your Mac you will be doing yourself a favor switching over to iTerm2. TABS! PANES! WOOT!

## Browsers 
### Google Chrome 
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is the most popular browser for web developers because of the powerful tools it provides to test code, manipulate documents, and measure performance. 

### Mozilla Firefox 
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is a free browser brought to you by Mozilla, some of the smartest people on the planet when it comes to web development. Their [Dev Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) are pretty sweet too.

## Text Editors
### Sublime Text 
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is my favorite text editor so far. It's "free," and has lots of customization options available using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). 
- [Get started](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/best-of-sublime-text-3-features-plugins-and-settings) here to get some really cool tips and tricks. 
- [Level Up Tuts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHEYF4EX3sAhVG2rTqCvLnsP) has an AWESOME set of videos for Sublime Text users that covers installation through deep customization. 

### Atom
[Atom](https://atom.io/) is another free browser brought to you by Github, and has Github integration and has an integrated package manager. Was very popular with several of my classmates.

### Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great editor, brought to you by Microsoft(!) and comes with features that typically be installable extensions in some of the other editors, such as: debugging, Git integration, and markdown preview... What's not to like?

### Brackets
[Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is from Adobe and is another free text editor. I honestly haven't used it but know it exists...

### Dillinger
[Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) is really more of a markdown (READMEs, this file, etc) editor with live preview, but I still really like it and use it all the time. It also has a nice link to a cheat sheet in the settings area.

### Codepen
[Codepen](https://codepen.io) is an online text editor and live preview site where you can see your programs in action, share your creations, "fork" other folks code, and generally learn how to do all sorts of cool things.

### Trello (Project Management)
[Trello]() is a web-based project management application using a kanban board with lists and assignable and moveable "cards" to illustrate the status of a particular issue/feature/item. Great for visual people!
- [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-trello-to-organize-your-entire-life-1683821040) has a nice "getting started" article for Trello.
