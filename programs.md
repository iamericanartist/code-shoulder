## Browsers 
#### Google Chrome 
[Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is the most popular browser for web developers because of the powerful tools it provides to test code, manipulate documents, and measure performance.

#### Mozilla Firefox 
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is a free browser brought to you by Mozilla, some of the smartest people on the planet when it comes to web development. Their [Dev Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) are pretty sweet too.

## Text Editors
#### Sublime Text 
[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is my favorite text editor so far. It's "free," and has lots of customization options available using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). 
- [Get started](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/best-of-sublime-text-3-features-plugins-and-settings) here to get some really cool tips and tricks. 
- [Level Up Tuts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHEYF4EX3sAhVG2rTqCvLnsP) has an AWESOME set of videos for Sublime Text users that covers installation through deep customization. 

#### Codepen
[Codepen](https://codepen.io) is an online text editor and live preview site where you can see your programs in action, share your creations, "fork" other folks code, and generally learn how to do all sorts of cool things.
