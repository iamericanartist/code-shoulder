# Things You're Probably Going to Need
***

### Github 
Visit [Github.com](https://github.com) and start your own free account. Github (you're here now if you're reading this) is a fantastic tool that facilitates online storage of all of your programs and allows you to contribute to other projects you come across. 

### iTerm2 
[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) was one of my fondest "discoveries" while in school. If you are using Terminal on your Mac you will be doing yourself a favor switching over to iTerm2. TABS! PANES! WOOT!

## Browsers 
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is the most popular browser for web developers because of the powerful tools it provides to test code, manipulate documents, and measure performance. 

- [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is a free browser brought to you by Mozilla, some of the smartest people on the planet when it comes to web development. Their [Dev Tools](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) are pretty sweet too.

## Text Editors
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) is my favorite text editor so far. It's "free," and has lots of customization options available using [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/). 
  - [Get started](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/best-of-sublime-text-3-features-plugins-and-settings) here to get some really cool tips and tricks. 
  - [Level Up Tuts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHEYF4EX3sAhVG2rTqCvLnsP) has an AWESOME set of videos for Sublime Text users that covers installation through deep customization. 

- [Atom](https://atom.io/) is another free browser brought to you by Github, and has Github integration and has an integrated package manager. Was very popular with several of my classmates.

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a great editor, brought to you by Microsoft(!) and comes with features that typically be installable extensions in some of the other editors, such as: debugging, Git integration, and markdown preview... What's not to like?

- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) is from Adobe and is another free text editor. I honestly haven't used it but know it exists...

- [Dillinger](http://dillinger.io/) is really more of a markdown (READMEs, this file, etc) editor with live preview, but I still really like it and use it all the time. It also has a nice link to a cheat sheet in the settings area.

- [Codepen](https://codepen.io) is an online text editor and live preview site where you can see your programs in action, share your creations, "fork" other folks code, and generally learn how to do all sorts of cool things.
- [Glitch.com](https://glitch.com/about/) is a quick way to get started on a project and looks simple but is rather deep. "Glitch isn't a "dumbed down" version of a real developer environment â€” your Glitch app runs on the exact same cloud infrastructure and Node.js engine that the best developers use to run their apps." - per their site.

## Colaborative Text Editors
- [Floobits](https://floobits.com) is a real-time collaborative text editor (IDE - Integrated development environment), which can tie in to your existing Sublime Text, Atom, and a few other editors. We used this a lot in class to "pair code" on the projector and not have to constantly be typing. Really cool tool.

- [Codeshare](https://codeshare.io/) is another real-time collaborative text editor that you can use to pair code with NO SIGNUP REQUIRED. I've used a couple times and it was dead simple and easy to use.

## Other  
- [Trello](https://trello.com) is a web-based project management application using a kanban board with lists and assignable and moveable "cards" to illustrate the status of a particular issue/feature/item. Great for visual people!  
  - [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/how-to-use-trello-to-organize-your-entire-life-1683821040) has a nice "getting started" article for Trello.  
- [RegExr](http://regexr.com/) for all your RegEx needs... A nice way to figure out what you're doing with RegEx.
- [Protovue](https://github.com/v1Labs/protovue) is a "prototyping component library" creator for use with Vue.js that is "for designers and developers to quickly scaffold mock app layouts for their prototypes."
