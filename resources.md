## Books 
- [A Smarter Way to Learn HTML & CSS](https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-Way-Learn-HTML-CSS/dp/150867387X/ref=pd_bxgy_14_img_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=2DVYKSXB5XPP2CYGE87R) is by Mark Myers and is required reading at Nashville Software School. 
- [A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript](https://www.amazon.com/Smarter-JavaScript-tech-assisted-approach-requires/dp/1497408180/ref=pd_sim_14_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=XTDA4VDWEYNHN5ZZXHAT) is another book by Mark Myers and is also required reading at Nashville Software School. 
- [Web Design with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery Set](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Design-HTML-JavaScript-jQuery/dp/1118907442/ref=la_B001IR3Q7I_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1483520705&sr=1-1) by Jon Duckett is on Amazon and I would suggest buying both books as the combo I believe is within $5 of the JavaScript book by itself! Great books for visual people!

- GitBook's [Front-End Developer Handbook 2017](https://www.gitbook.com/book/frontendmasters/front-end-handbook-2017/details) "broadly outlines and discusses the practice of front-end engineering: how to learn it and what tools are used when practicing it in 2017." - Free E-Book in various formats! Check out some of [GitBook's other offerings too...](https://www.gitbook.com/explore)  
- [This repo is amazing](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)! Has a list of free programming books, free courses, resources, and more. NIIIICE.
- [97 Things Every Programmer Should Know](https://www.gitbook.com/book/97-things-every-x-should-know/97-things-every-programmer-should-know/details) is another GitBook.com offering and so far a pretty good read. It is a free version of the O'Reilly book by the same name.

- [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) is a free site that gives a "beginner to developer" track and focuses on Ruby/Ruby on Rails alongside the standard CSS, HTML, Javascript and JQuery stuff. I've heard from a good friend it's pretty great!

## Further Learning / Katas / Challenges 
- https://javascript30.com/ is a cool concept brought to you by Wes Bos at [HackerYou](http://hackeryou.com/) and is meant for beginner to intermediate devs. 
- http://es6katas.org/ is a great way to learn some of the newer (as of mid 2016 at least) ECMAScript 6 updates and features. They are in an interesting order (mostly grouped by what they affect) and sometimes the answers are REALLY SIMPLE. These can also be rather hard... 
- [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a place to sharpen your code chops. I feel like this is meant for intermediate and above coders. There is a "test" to be able to use the site, and from there you can work on all sorts of skills. 
- [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) "is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve."
